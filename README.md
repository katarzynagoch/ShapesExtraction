# ShapesExtraction
Extracting the coordinates of shapes ndoes from a learning dataset of images. Project for course Machine Learning at University of Muenster.
## Instalation
To run the scripts, you need the to install following library (using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)):
- [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
## Scripts
A short code snippet for extracting coordinates of the nodes of shapes representing simplified birds. Produced coordinates are saved in a csv file.
[HCD.py](https://github.com/katarzynagoch/ShapesExtraction/blob/master/HCD.py) script utilises [cornerHarris](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d0d/tutorial_py_features_harris.html) 
function from [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) library.
